## PPSSPP Track A: the core builds

Plan: [PPSSPP_Implementation_Plan.md](../PPSSPP_Implementation_Plan.md); platform
analysis: [PPSSPP_Core_Plan.md](../PPSSPP_Core_Plan.md). Track A is PPSSPP on its
software GPU core, with no PS5_Vulkan dependency.

**Done — A1-A3: build, ABI and title link.** `tools/build-ppsspp.sh` fetches pinned
`f293b10` (29 submodules) and ABI-checks a core with **zero `PT_TLS`** and `NEEDED`
exactly the three allowed modules; `ppsspp` is in `core_names`, so the title links it.
`thread_local` needed no patch (the SDK uses `-femulated-tls`); two flag shims
(`static_assert`, `ZSTD_TRACE`) and a libc shim carry the vendored code.
Reproducibility: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the pinned commit, two builds byte-identical.

**Done — A4: the core loads on the console.** The loader diagnostic passes:
`cycles=8, exports=25, api=1`, identity `73d2aad8…`, `ran 110 initializers`,
`symbols=19430 relocations=24812 mapped_bytes=18923520`. Three blockers fell, each
found on the console: unresolvable imports (four `libScePosixForWebKit` symbols now
shimmed, 83 OpenGL ones excluded by `patches/ppsspp/0003-no-opengl.patch`; table 497 →
410 bindings), the thread pool (256/512 → **16/32**), and the runtime assets
(`assets/` from the pinned source, 193 files, staged to `dist/…/system/PPSSPP` and
published to `/app0/system/PPSSPP`). Evidence: `evidence/ppsspp-native/`.

**Blocker — the first frame.** The title takes a SIGSEGV on a worker thread during
`ThreadManager::Init` (fault address 0x70, frames inside `libkernel.sprx`), so no PSP
frame has been presented. Renderer-independent, and next.

**Driver: rung 1.0 closed, title relinked.** `PS5_Vulkan` `d4e73ff`, embedded
`libps5vk.ps5.a` `d41f934b…`, title identity `735f7eb1…`, all five gates pass. Still
missing for PPSSPP's Vulkan renderer: a **combined depth/stencil format** (only D16 and
D32F exist; PPSSPP asserts without one of D24S8/D32S8/D16S8 — the device-creation
blocker), **attachments smaller than 3840x2160**, **cull mode**, **colour write
masks**, **stencil test with dynamic stencil state** and **dynamic blend constants**.

## Now

**Owner accepted the thumbnail and configuration-reset fixes: “Perfect. Commit”.**
Landing on `main`; evidence: `evidence/thumbnail-input-defaults/`.
Details and regression checks: `docs/THUMBNAIL_INPUT_DEFAULTS.md`.

- Async image loading discarded the requested RGBA flag; patch 0081 preserves it.
  Gameplay pixels and saved PNG encoding are unchanged.
- Compiled input was ps5 but joypad default was null; patch 0082 selects ps5.
  Reset also clears auto-binds without recreating the driver, so the next pad poll
  now reannounces the connected controller once to restore the built-in profile.
- Three regression tests failed before the fixes; all four focused tests pass
  afterward, including native-pad recovery without new samples or a device reopen.
- All five gates pass: 74 tests, 278 frontend sources; normal diagnostics mode.
  Identity: `e11018a79a62ce91fa723deaad6939c1e48a47bace21b3527ae84f4452148451`.
  Exact artifacts/gate logs: `klog/thumbnail-input-build/`; sanitized host report
  in evidence/thumbnail-input-defaults/. Driver archives and Mesa utility objects
  match the accepted normal XMB build. Logging and PS5_Vulkan unchanged.
- Uploaded eboot only after idle checks, runtime identity read back, live config
  unchanged. Capture: `klog/thumbnail-input-upload-20260919-205531/`. Saved joypad
  selection was empty (automatic), not null; no configuration repair was needed.
  No launch/kill sent. Owner accepted the fixes after deployment. No fresh console
  logs or individual checklist results were captured; acceptance is owner observation.

## Accepted baselines

- XMB: `601e575` fixed large-list allocation failures, `6b857a9` merged the README;
  the owner confirmed crash-free navigation and the normal build removed the
  five-second hitches. Detail: `docs/XMB_LIST_SAFETY.md`,
  `evidence/xmb-safe-list-run/`.
- Gameplay: Genesis Plus GX frontend `ecfcddd5…` with all five gates green and owner
  acceptance of colours, sound, controls and menu/next-game transitions;
  FCEUmm, mGBA, Snes9x and FBNeo evidence stays in `native-core-loading/`,
  `mgba-native/`, `snes9x-native/` and `fbneo-native/`. Core pins, hashes and
  acceptance limits are in `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`.

## Failure being addressed

Resolved and superseded. The XMB large-list crash (`601e575`), the hitches after it
and the thumbnail/input defaults (`e11018a`) are all accepted; the investigation
record is `docs/XMB_ALLOCATION_INVESTIGATION.md`, the fix notes
`docs/XMB_LIST_SAFETY.md` and `docs/THUMBNAIL_INPUT_DEFAULTS.md`, and the raw
captures are `klog/xmb-*` with evidence under `evidence/xmb-*` and
`evidence/thumbnail-input-defaults/`. The unsafe driver error logger under
arbitrary OOM remains outside the frontend fix.

## Previous console-verified baseline

Superseded by the baselines above and recorded in full in `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`: the
Genesis Plus GX run `ecfcddd5…` (66 tests, owner-confirmed gameplay) and the FCEUmm,
mGBA, Snes9x and FBNeo runs whose evidence stays in `native-core-loading/`,
`mgba-native/`, `snes9x-native/` and `fbneo-native/`.

## Named errors and remaining limits

- First frontend snapshot has five intentional missing-core recovery errors and
  two archive-extraction failures. The owner identified the failing content as
  ARCADE - Sega System 16 & 32: these boards belong to FBNeo, not Genesis Plus GX.
  Archive structure was not inspected; no general archive fix is inferred.
- Second-launch frontend snapshot has zero ERROR lines. Neither run records an
  invalid bitmap viewport or rejected XRGB8888 format.
- Console verification does not cover every supported Sega system, BIOS/disc/CHD,
  NTSC/interlace options, SRAM/state round trips, long-run A/V or performance.
  Silence/discard counters include menu/start/stop; zero backend errors is not
  proof of uninterrupted audio across all workloads.
- Existing upstream compiler warnings include old zlib prototypes, Tremor's
  long-to-int abs conversion and unused blip_discard_samples_dirty missing return.
  That blip helper has no callers in this source. Disc codecs remain unverified
  on console; warnings are not suppressed or treated as runtime acceptance.
- Loader still rejects TLS, legacy init/fini, nonempty preinit and unsupported
  relocations/dependencies. General unwind registration is absent. Cores share
  the frontend process; safe load rejection cannot isolate arbitrary core faults.

## Preserved platform and file locations

XMB stays default and RGUI selectable. Vulkan remains the presentation route;
video_ps5 stays selectable as CPU fallback. Native audio/input/binding, config
saving, FTP permissions and directory browsing remain. Useful logs are retained.
Deployments preserve live settings/games.

FTP base `/data/homebrew/PPSA99169/` corresponds to in-title `/app0`.
Use content/, system/, cores/, config/retroarch.cfg, savefiles/, savestates/.
Genesis Plus GX Sega CD BIOS files use system/ root; FBNeo uses system/fbneo/.
See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for procedures and metadata-listed BIOS filenames.

## Operating notes

Uploads are authorized; check console idle before deployment. A new launch needs
owner intervention. Start klog first, preserve old logs and capture allocation,
frontend and trace logs. Never interrupt another title. Preserve crash/freeze logs
before relaunch. No new core or unrelated driver work is assigned by this file.
