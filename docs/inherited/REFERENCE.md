# PS5 RetroArch: reference

Stable reference. Edit when the specification changes. This file holds the step
ladder, the workflow that turns a step into a commit, and the environment facts
every session needs. It does not hold progress, run results or next actions:
those are `docs/ACTIVE.md` and `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`.

## M0: the contract

| Step | What | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0.1 | Fill the documentation contract: this file's ladder, the gates in `docs/PLAN.md`, the environment table below, and the procedures in `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | `grep -rno '{{[A-Z0-9_]*}}' AGENTS.md docs tools` returns nothing, and every command named in a gate exists as a file in `tools/` |
| M0.2 | Pin the toolchain and the upstream source: `tools/doctor.sh` proves the SDK and every host tool, `tools/fetch-retroarch.sh` fetches the pinned revision and checks the tree it got against that commit | `tools/doctor.sh` exits 0 and names each resolved path; `tools/fetch-retroarch.sh --check` prints the pin and what is present, and a second run is a no-op |
| M0.3 | Compile the frontend's own sources, to prove the toolchain end to end: `tools/retroarch-sources.sh` asks RetroArch's build which objects a link needs, `tools/build-retroarch.sh` compiles them | `tools/build-retroarch.sh` reports how many sources it compiled and archives them into `build/ra/libretroarch.a`; every source it could not compile is named in its report |
| M0.4 | Stage the title: `sce_sys/param.json`, the presentation assets, the runtime and the signed image in the layout the loader reads | `bash tools/build-title.sh` writes `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` with `eboot.bin`, `sce_sys/` and `sce_module/libc.prx`, and records `manifest.sha256`; `bash tools/check-manifest.sh` verifies it and `tools/verify.sh integration` passes on it |
| M0.5 | The gate runner: `tools/verify.sh` runs format, unit, build, integration, evidence in order and fails fast | `tools/verify.sh` exits 0 on a clean tree and exits 1 at the first red gate; `tools/verify.sh --list` prints the five commands |

## M1: the console shell

| Step | What | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1.1 | A minimal PS5 payload that prints its identity through the SDK's stdio and exits | The ELF loads on the console and the captured `klog` holds the identity line; `evidence/m1.1/` carries the capture and the expected line |
| M1.2 | The platform driver that owns a title's lifetime: user service, splash screen, and an exit path that does not return from `main` | Console run shows the splash hidden by our call and a clean close from the home screen; the capture is committed |
| M1.3 | VideoOut bring-up behind a project-owned seam: acquire buffers, present a solid frame, release on shutdown | A frame is presented on the console and the run's capture names the resolution it received (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, "Observing a target run") |
| M1.4 | RetroArch's frontend enters the platform driver and reaches its own main loop in a headless configuration | The console run logs the frontend's own version and driver identity, and the host build of the same step passes `tools/verify.sh` |

## M2: video and input

| Step | What | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M2.1 | Choose the backend with evidence: build against the installed OpenGL 3.3 Core package and list the entry points RetroArch's GL driver resolves against what the package exports | `tools/check-gl-exports.sh` prints the resolved and the missing lists; either the missing list is empty, or it is quoted in full in `docs/FINDINGS.md` and the step closes as a decision to wait for PS5_Vulkan's rung |
| M2.2 | A platform video driver and its matching display context: the console's display is opened, the swapchain or context is created from the backend's public entry points, and nothing else in this repository touches the GPU | The console run shows RetroArch's own driver identity line and the resolution it received; the capture is committed under `evidence/m2.2/` |
| M2.3 | The menu is drawn: the first visible interface, on whichever backend the driver provides | A console run presents a menu frame; the capture holds the driver name, the swapchain extent, the present count and a frame digest. A framebuffer-only driver cannot satisfy this — `docs/FINDINGS.md` records why the display context is what draws a menu |
| M2.4 | Controller input through the payload SDK's pad API into RetroArch's input driver | The capture records the buttons pressed and the menu's reaction, from the mapping table written in this file |
| M2.5 | A libretro core loads and runs one frame of content, headless first and then presented | The core's own identification line, the frame digest and the present count sit in one capture under `evidence/m2.5/` |

## M3: cores and storage

| Step | What | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M3.1 | Core discovery and installation: the scan path, the `.info` metadata and the load path | A console run lists the staged cores and loads one by name; the capture names the core and its version |
| M3.2 | Save and save-state paths on the console's own storage, with the write-through discipline `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` describes | A state written on the console is read back after a relaunch, and both runs are captured |
| M3.3 | Configuration persistence: `retroarch.cfg` round-trips through the console's storage without losing keys | The diff between the seeded config and the config read back after a settings change names only the changed key |
| M3.4 | A second core of a different class (a non-dynarec, non-GL core) loads, runs and exits | Two core names appear in two captures, each with its own content digest |

## M4: audio, mapping and release

| Step | What | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M4.1 | Audio output through the payload SDK's audio API, with the buffer discipline documented in `docs/FINDINGS.md` | The console run reports the audio format it opened and the frames written; a captured run holds no underrun line |
| M4.2 | Input mapping: buttons, sticks, the menu combo and the PlayStation confirm/cancel convention | A capture records each mapped button's effect once, from a written mapping table in this file |
| M4.3 | The menus at 1080p: readable text, bounded frame time, and no layout that depends on a mouse | A console run at the target resolution with the frame-time record committed |
| M4.4 | Release: the ZIP, its `SHA256SUMS`, and one acceptance run end to end | The release artifact's digest, the run's capture and the expected lines are committed under `evidence/m4.4/` |

Acceptance is the contract. A step is done when its acceptance line is satisfied
word for word, and the evidence it names is committed. A step whose acceptance
was wrong is corrected in this file, in its own commit, before the code that
depends on it lands.

## The workflow

| Phase | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Spike | Time-boxed, throwaway, never committed as product code. What it learned goes to `docs/FINDINGS.md`. |
| Step | One commit, one acceptance line, verified before it lands. |
| Milestone | Its steps are all done and its gate in `docs/PLAN.md` holds. |

### Turning a step into a commit

1. Restate the acceptance line, and name the artifact that will prove it.
2. Build the smallest thing that can satisfy it.
3. Run the gates in `AGENTS.md`; fix what fails.
4. Commit with the evidence: what was run, what it returned, what it proves.
5. Write the step up once in `docs/ACTIVE.md`; append a dated entry to
   `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`.

### Splitting and parking

- If a step needs two independent proofs, it is two steps. Split it in
  `docs/PLAN.md`/this file first, then build the first one.
- If a step cannot be verified in this environment (it needs the console, a
  loader the console does not have yet, or the Vulkan driver before its rung is
  reached), implement it and park it in `parked/` as a patch plus the
  verification plan. It is not merged and it is not "done".

## The environment

*Verified on this host with `tools/doctor.sh`. Every session otherwise
re-derives these, at full price.*

| Thing | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Host | CachyOS (Arch-based) Linux, x86-64, bash 5.3, Python 3.14 |
| Host compiler and formatter | clang / clang-format / clang-tidy 22.1.8, `llvm-ar`, `ccache` |
| PS5 SDK | `$PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK`, default `/home/mihawk/ps5-payload-sdk`, unpacked 2026-09-17; environment from `$PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK/toolchain/prospero.sh` |
| PS5 compiler | `prospero-clang` 22.1.8, target `x86_64-sie-ps5`; sysroot `$PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK/target` |
| Upstream source | RetroArch 1.22.2 tarball, fetched into the ignored `vendor/`, patched per `patches/series` |
| Build | `bash tools/build-title.sh` → `dist/<TITLE_ID>/eboot.bin`, signed and manifested; `bash tools/verify.sh build` runs the same command |
| Test | `tools/verify.sh unit` (host-native, GoogleTest) and `tools/verify.sh integration` (shell and Python against the staged tree) |
| Format and lint | `tools/verify.sh format` (`clang-format --dry-run --Werror`, `bash -n`, `python3 -m py_compile`, attribution and JSON checks) |
| Run locally | host-native frontend against the headless driver: `build/host/retroarch --features` and the unit suite; no console is touched |
| Target | A PS5 title folder: a signed fake-self `eboot.bin` (x86-64) with `sce_module/libc.prx` and `sce_sys/`, which is what the console's loader runs |
| Graphics on the target | the relocatable OpenGL 3.3 Core package from `../ps5-opengl-sdk-0.2.0` today, and the Vulkan driver from `../PS5_Vulkan` once it reaches rung 1.0 — see "The graphics backend" below; neither is rebuilt here |
| Vulkan headers for our build | `../ps5-opengl-sdk-0.2.0/third_party/Vulkan-Headers/include`, the vendored copy the local driver builds against; the payload SDK's sysroot ships none |
| Console tools | the resident control payload and `ps5_console.py` from `../PS5_Vulkan` (`launch`, `kill`, `klog` on port 3232); address and credentials come from the ignored `.env` |
| Source of truth for deps | `pin/sources.txt` (versions and SHA-256) and `patches/series` (the patch order) |

## Versions and pins

Anything pinned is pinned here, with the reason. Nothing is pinned in two
places, and nothing is upgraded without a line in `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`.

| Pin | Version | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RetroArch source | 1.22.2, `sha256 245ef18c8fa8fbd9fbb5eb25cf43e17c6aace2f95c1ed99873cbd794012bb232` | The newest upstream tag that carries the Vulkan context driver and the frontend the port needs; the digest is the tarball's own, so a moved tag is caught |
| PS5 payload SDK | `$PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK`, unpacked 2026-09-17 | The only toolchain that produces PS5 payload ELFs; the version is recorded in `pin/sources.txt` so a build is reproducible from a checkout |
| Vulkan driver | from `../PS5_Vulkan` at the revision recorded in `pin/sources.txt` | The driver is this project's graphics backend; a revision that changes a driver entry point must be a deliberate, recorded bump |
| Graphics backend (current) | `../ps5-opengl-sdk-0.2.0`, release 0.2.0, consumed through its installed package | It is the only graphics stack with a recorded hardware acceptance run on this machine; the driver package is never rebuilt here |
| GoogleTest | host-only, fetched and digest-verified into `.deps/test/` | Unit tests run on the host; it is never linked into a PS5 artifact |

## The graphics backend

Two local projects provide graphics; this repository builds neither. Which one a
step uses is recorded in the step's acceptance line, and the choice is evidence
driven, not stylistic.

| Stage | Backend | How this repository consumes it | What it decides |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Now | OpenGL 3.3 Core from `../ps5-opengl-sdk-0.2.0` | its relocatable package, through `ps5-opengl-core33.mk` or its `ps5-opengl-core33.pc`; headers are EGL, GL and KHR | RetroArch's OpenGL path, with the frontend rendering through our own platform context driver |
| After PS5_Vulkan rung 1.0 | the Vulkan driver from `../PS5_Vulkan` | its released static archive; Vulkan headers come from the SDK's vendored copy | RetroArch's `vulkan` context driver, which is the target backend for the shipped application |

Rules that hold either way:

- The application never opens a GPU device directly. It issues EGL/GL or Vulkan
  calls through RetroArch's own context driver, so the backend can be swapped
  without touching the frontend.
- Whichever backend is in use is named in the run's capture, and a step that
  changes backend is its own step with its own acceptance run.
- A backend that fails the step is a finding in `docs/FINDINGS.md` with the exact
  call that failed, not a reason to add private GPU access here.

The first M2 step settles the OpenGL question with evidence rather than
assumption: RetroArch's GL driver resolves its entry points through `glsym`, and
a backend that exports fewer functions than the driver asks for fails at load
time. `tools/check-gl-exports.sh` compares the backend's exported symbol list
with the driver's request list and reports the difference; if the difference is
not empty, that difference is the M2 finding and PS5_Vulkan's rung becomes the
blocking dependency for a presented frame.

## Shipping as a PPSA title

The console needs an `eboot.bin` in a title folder with `sce_sys/param.json`
carrying a `PPSA#####` id. This project produces one through
`../ps5-native-app-boilerplate-main`'s pipeline, which is the path already proven
on this console: ProsperoLight, built the same way, starts when placed.

| Piece | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- |
| the tooling that links and signs `eboot.bin` | `tooling/`, taken from the native pipeline and committed as part of this project |
| the loader-visible runtime module | `runtime/libc.prx`, checked against its own digest manifest |
| the title's identity and launcher assets | `sce_sys/`, written by the scaffold from `title/` |
| the application | RetroArch's sources, compiled by `tools/build-retroarch.sh`, linked with `src/` |

The pipeline's builder compiles `src/**/*.{c,cc,cpp}` with fixed flags
(`-std=c11`, `-std=c++20`, `-O2 -Wall -Wextra -ffunction-sections
-fdata-sections`) and links the result with its own CRT, C++ runtime, AGC link
stubs and version script. Two consequences shape this project:

- **RetroArch is reached by include path, not copied in.** Its tree is dozens of
  directories with its own configure step, so `tools/build-retroarch.sh` compiles
  it separately with the same compiler and the generated `config.h`, and `src/`
  holds only this project's code — the entry point and the video driver.
- **Extra link inputs arrive through `APP_STATIC_ARCHIVES`.** That is how a
  graphics backend is added when a step needs one; the Vulkan driver's archive is
  the intended first use.

## Reference material

Two directories hold material this project did not write, and they are different
kinds of thing:

| Path | Committed | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reference/` | yes, with a `PROVENANCE.txt` naming the source, the revision and every file's digest | read-only. It is what a claim was measured against; a change to it is its own step, and the digests are re-recorded in that step |
| `vendor/` | no, ignored | build-time only. `tools/fetch-retroarch.sh` recreates it from the pin on every clean build, so nothing in it can be relied on to persist |

Neither is edited to get a step unblocked. A change we want in either one is a
patch in `patches/` or a documented decision, never a quiet edit.

## Style

- C and C++ follow the upstream RetroArch style inside `platform/` and the
  project's own `clang-format` configuration: 4-space indent, 80 columns, braces
  on the same line for control flow. Run `tools/verify.sh format` before staging.
- Shell scripts start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`, quote
  every expansion, and exit 2 on a usage error and 1 on a check failure — the
  convention the console tools in `../PS5_Vulkan` already use.
- Generated code, vendored dependencies and build output are never edited by
  hand and never reformatted: `vendor/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `.deps/`, `*.elf`,
  `*.so`, and everything under a git-ignored capture directory. `reference/` is
  committed but equally read-only: it is the baseline a measurement was taken
  against.

## The port

RetroArch on this console is a video driver of this repository's own, presented
through the display layer in `src/display.cpp`. Two menus are available and the
choice is a backend choice, not a preference:

| Menu | Display context | What it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RGUI | none — `menu/drivers/rgui.c` references `dispctx` **zero** times | `poke->set_texture_frame`, `viewport_info`, `video_driver_supports_rgba` |
| XMB, Ozone, MaterialUI | required — XMB dereferences `dispctx` 72 times | a GPU backend: every entry in `gfx_display_ctx_drivers[]` is a GPU API and there is no software one |

So RGUI is the first target: it rasterises the menu into its own framebuffer and
hands that one texture to the video driver, which means it runs over VideoOut with
no GPU stack at all. XMB comes after, over `../PS5_Vulkan`
(284 `ps5vk_` symbols in `libps5vk.ps5.a`) once the frontend is already proven.

The mandatory surface is small, and the rest is optional:

| Interface | Mandatory | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video_driver_t` | `init`, `suppress_screensaver`, `alive`, `frame`, `ident`, `poke_interface` | `suppress_screensaver` is called with no NULL check; the rest are NULL-guarded |
| `video_poke_interface_t` | `set_texture_frame` | RGUI pushes its menu framebuffer through it |
| `gfx_ctx_driver_t` | not needed at all | `video_driver_init_internal` never touches one |

Field order matters: the struct is initialised positionally, and `overlay_interface`
sits inside `#ifdef HAVE_OVERLAY` before `poke_interface`, so an initialiser has to
account for it.

## XMB menu assets and build selection

XMB uses RetroArch's existing Vulkan display driver; no new graphics backend or
runtime dependency is added. Configure enables XMB and retains RGUI; upstream's
default selection prefers XMB when Ozone/MaterialUI are disabled. The seed config
matches that selection. Configure arguments are fingerprinted before feature
flags are derived so an existing configured tree cannot silently retain RGUI-only
objects. `ASSETS_DIR` is `/app0`, since platform_unix appends `/assets` itself.
The title currently selects the null platform frontend, so that Unix initializer
does not execute: patch 0063 seeds `/app0/assets` directly in configuration
defaults and records the resolved XMB paths and load result at context reset.

`assets/xmb/source.json` pins the official libretro/retroarch-assets revision
73106363e14e34c08a5854b4cfbc29f184e3b783 and hashes the shipped subset: all 120
fixed menu icons named by RetroArch 1.22.2's xmb_texture_path, the monochrome M+ 1p
font, attribution and licenses. This pin makes the required menu artwork
reproducible without downloading assets at build/run time. Per-system playlist
icons are not shipped yet; standard default/content icons are included.

The XMB ribbon retains its two-float shader layout but uploads a zero-padded
16-byte uniform block (named patch 0060), matching libps5vk's current whole-record
restriction. This is frontend compatibility padding, not general support for
arbitrary UBO ranges in the driver. Named patch 0061 expands each triangle strip
into list vertices with alternating winding and submits the expanded count for
both effect and icon draws. `tests/test_xmb_assets.py` executes the C index mapping
for strips through the full 8,064-vertex ribbon and checks bounds and winding.

Named patch 0062 also binds the existing white texture and nearest sampler for
untextured menu effects. The ribbon shader does not sample them, but libps5vk
currently validates all stage-visible descriptor layout entries rather than just
statically used shader bindings. This uses the same descriptor-fill compatibility
path as textured draws (including patch 0026's second sampler slot).

Named patch 0065 keeps texture coordinates consistent with the physical image
width required by the driver's row alignment. RGBA8 rows need 64-texel alignment;
R8 font rows need 256-texel alignment. Display UVs are scaled to the logical image
region and font atlas offsets are normalized by the physical width. Padding only
the image width changes what a normalized coordinate samples.

Named patch 0066 keeps static/menu textures at one mip level. XMB's full mipmapped
icons rendered as repeated/cropped fragments in the tested libps5vk path; the
single-level images render correctly. This is a compatibility limit, not proof
that the driver's general mip-chain storage/sampling is correct. RGUI and the
CPU video driver remain compiled and selectable. The retired screenshot recipe
is `parked/xmb-readback/README.md`; screenshots are not taken by normal builds.

## Native PS5 audio

`src/audio_ps5.cpp` adapts ProsperoLight's `sceAudioOutInit/Open/Output/Close`
sequence to RetroArch's `audio_driver_t`. Patch 0067 registers `audio_ps5` and
selects `ps5` by default; the staged config agrees. The backend opens the system
user's main output at 48,000 Hz, signed 16-bit interleaved stereo, 256 frames per
native output call. `new_rate` tells RetroArch to resample other source rates.
Only the default device is supported. No SDL or Opus dependency is introduced.

A dedicated worker feeds AudioOut, whose synchronous output call paces playback.
The producer and consumer share a bounded ring guarded by a mutex/condition;
no lock is held while calling AudioOut. Requested latency sizes the ring in
256-frame multiples, with a 512-frame minimum and 8,192-frame maximum. A zero
latency request uses 64 ms (3,072 frames). An additional native block can be in
flight. `write`, `write_avail` and `buffer_size` use bytes, matching RetroArch's
call sites. Blocking writes wait for space; nonblocking writes return the bytes
accepted, including zero when full. Empty or partial blocks are zero-filled.

Pause drops queued samples, waits for the in-flight block, then drains the native
port. Resume uses the same worker. Free wakes and joins the worker before draining
and closing the port. Output errors make the driver inactive and wake blocked
writers. Startup, failures and close summaries are logged; successful blocks are
not individually logged. Silence includes normal idle/menu output and padding,
so it is not by itself evidence of a streaming underrun.

The opt-in backend test is documented in `docs/TESTING.md`. Core integration,
long-duration A/V synchronization and streaming underrun behavior need their own
content-based acceptance runs; native test tones do not prove those properties.

## Native platform frontend and paths

`frontend_ctx_ps5` supplies platform initialization, a startup environment callback
and a drive-list callback (patch 0068). Its non-null environment callback keeps the
initial command line intact. Without it, task_content substitutes
`menu_content_environment_get`, reconstructs argv from empty startup state and
loses `-c`. Subsequent menu-initiated content loads retain upstream's menu callback.

The frontend seeds `g_defaults` with paths under `/app0`, creates the title's own
config/core/content/system/save/playlist directories, and copies the packaged seed
to `/app0/config/retroarch.cfg` only when that file is absent. A temporary file and
rename avoid installing a partial copy. Existing configs are left intact, including
when a newer packaged seed is uploaded. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` maps these internal
paths to FTP. Platform defaults apply when an existing config leaves paths unset.

Patch 0069 returns `/app0/eboot.bin` for application-path discovery. The generic
Unix procfs/getpid/readlink path is inappropriate for a PS5 title; configuration
saving invokes it while abbreviating paths. Patch 0070 routes RetroArch's VFS
`opendir/readdir/closedir` calls through `src/ps5_directory.cpp`. The adapter uses
public SDK `open(O_DIRECTORY)`, `getdents`, and `close`, validates variable-length
FreeBSD records, skips deleted entries and returns directory types/names. Reads
use a 64 KiB buffer: 4 KiB failed with EINVAL on the tested `/app0` mount even
though it worked on `/`; 64 KiB succeeded. The minimum accepted size was not
determined. It does
not change file reads/writes or bypass the title's filesystem permissions.

The title compiles against the configured libretro-common include tree. Its
headers resolve relative `config.h` includes there; using the pristine vendor
include tree fails as soon as the native frontend includes the menu interfaces.
No new dependency, SDK version or graphics-driver change is involved.

Managed directories (`config`, `cores`, `content`, `system`, `savefiles`,
`savestates`, `playlists`) use mode `0777`. Startup applies `chmod` after `mkdir`,
including when the directory already exists, so an inherited umask cannot remove
FTP write access and older `0755` directories are repaired. Mode `0775` was
applied but still denied real FTP uploads on this console, despite matching
groups in directory listings; the owner authorized `0777`. This policy
changes only those directory modes; it does not recursively rewrite user files.

### Native joypad and binding interface

`input_ps5` pairs with `ps5_joypad`, registered before the null joypad. The joypad
owns the single initial-user pad handle and exposes 16 raw buttons plus six axes
(left X/Y, right X/Y, L2/R2). The built-in `PS5 Controller` profile maps them to
RetroPad defaults through RetroArch's normal autoconfiguration. Existing saved
configs with an empty joypad driver select it automatically; new seeds name
`ps5`. Explicit user bindings override the profile.

The input interface adds no raw gamepad state: OR-ing the old direct mapping into
RetroArch's mapped state would make reassigned buttons remain active. Menu analog
navigation and binding capture use the joypad callbacks. Sticks span -32767 to
32767 centered on byte 128; triggers span 0 to 32767. RetroArch owns deadzone and
axis-threshold handling. A zero-sample read preserves the previous sample (the
binding screen may poll twice); errors/disconnects and shell interception suppress
input. No per-frame or per-button logging is added. Rumble and multiple controllers
remain unsupported in this backend.


## FCEUmm core build

`make fceumm` (or `tools/build-fceumm.sh`) cross-builds the pinned upstream
FCEUmm revision and its pinned core-info metadata. The script verifies both
input SHA-256 digests, extracts fresh sources into `build/cores/fceumm`, and
uses this project's `.deps/native/ps5-payload-sdk` wrappers for CC/CXX/AR/LD.
It does not modify the fetched upstream source. `platform=unix` selects upstream
source/features, while explicit compiler and linker make variables prevent a
host build. The linker is the compiler driver because upstream passes `-Wl`
options; `-nostdlib -nodefaultlibs` excludes payload CRT/static libc defaults.
The `--build-id=sha1` override replaces Clang's random PS5 UUID with a
content-derived ELF ID so repeated builds have stable hashes.
`-T tooling/native/ps5-core.ld` separates executable, read-only and writable
segments on 16 KiB boundaries; the loader never maps writable executable pages.
The core checker rejects a writable executable load segment.
Math and libc imports come from the native runtime stubs, with `libkernel_web`
rather than the payload `libkernel_sys`. No SDL or decoder is added.

Outputs are `build/cores/stage/cores/fceumm_libretro.so` and
`build/cores/stage/info/fceumm_libretro.info`. `tools/build-title.sh` builds and
copies both after assembling the title, before recording its manifest. Native
core metadata defaults to `/app0/info`. The same `.info` file is also staged
beside the core because older saved configs set `libretro_info_path = ""`;
upstream then searches the core directory. Existing settings are preserved.
`build/cores/fceumm/build.json` records
source/metadata pins, hashes, ELF imports, exported callbacks and compiler-wrapper
identity. First use requires network access; verified cached inputs allow offline
rebuilds. `JOBS` controls build parallelism.

The reference was john-tornblom's websrv
[core build script](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/blob/master/homebrew/RetroArch/build-snes9x2010.sh).
Only its fetch/build/stage pattern applies here: this application uses the native
title pipeline and its own SDK. A shared ELF passing the ABI gate is not proof
that the native title's dynamic loader can load it. FCEUmm renders NES frames in
software; RetroArch presents those frames through the existing Vulkan driver.

After uploading each `.info`, deployment writes and reads back RetroArch's
`core_info.refresh` marker in the same directory. RetroArch consumes it when
rebuilding its metadata cache; it is not a shipped manifest file. This also
refreshes entries previously cached as having no metadata.


## Native in-process core loader

`src/core_loader_ps5.cpp` supplies the dynamic-library operations used by the
frontend. It loads this pipeline's ELF64 x86-64 FreeBSD-ABI shared cores into
anonymous memory, resolves their imports against explicit title bindings,
applies checked RELA relocations, then protects each segment as RX, R or RW.
File reads use bounded POSIX reads into a separate mapped buffer. Failed opens
release allocations and report the failing operation; successful handles are
reference counted and unmapped on the final close.

`tools/core-imports.py` derives the union of required native bindings from the
explicitly shipped FCEUmm, mGBA, Snes9x, FBNeo and Genesis Plus GX ELFs; bindings and all cores participate in the title build
identity. Directory imports use this port's directory adapters, including `rewinddir`.
The `localtime_r` binding uses RetroArch's existing locked `rtime_localtime`
helper, initialized before gameplay. The
runtime dependencies are limited to the public kernel_web, libc and Posix stubs.
This route does not depend on websrv's payload loader hooks or publish native
module exports through the title converter.

The initial supported contract is deliberately narrower than a general dynamic
linker: no TLS, ELF interpreter, legacy DT_INIT/DT_FINI, C++ unwind
registration, REL/RELR, or additional dependent shared libraries. Bounded
DT_INIT_ARRAY callbacks are supported: every relocated pointer must target this
module's executable segment, and all callbacks are checked before any run.
Initializers run once per new mapping after protection, before exposing the
handle; a reference-counted reopen does not rerun them. Unsupported imports and
relocations fail explicitly. Adding another core requires reviewing this
contract and extending both host tests and target diagnostics as needed.

Core selection checks load success before content startup tears down drivers.
The main loop also refuses to poll drivers after frontend initialization fails.
This protects against load failures; it cannot isolate a fault inside arbitrary
core code running in the same process.


Software core frames in libretro XRGB8888 are converted by
`src/core_frame_ps5.cpp` to RGBA8 bytes with opaque alpha, respecting both row
pitches and in-place framebuffers. The Vulkan frontend requests RGBA8 for both
staging and sampled core textures. This extends the menu's matching-format
upload rule to actual content, avoiding the RGB565-only compute branch. Frame
scaling and presentation remain on the Vulkan GPU path; `video_ps5` stays
registered as the selectable fallback. RGB565 core frames retain their existing
path and require separate content acceptance.


## mGBA core build

`make mgba` runs `tools/build-mgba.sh` with the same SDK and ELF linker layout as
FCEUmm. The pinned source is the [official libretro mGBA tree](https://github.com/libretro/mgba/tree/7a12d6d4b9acb14c0ae62c9166b6a2f3d08007f6).
Source and `.info` inputs have verified SHA-256 digests; a fresh extraction goes
to `build/cores/mgba/`. CMake is required by this source revision. The wrapper in
`tooling/mgba/` selects only the shared libretro target, both GB and GBA engines,
software XRGB8888 output, and native kernel_web/libc/Posix imports. External
frontend/media dependencies are disabled: RetroArch supplies presentation,
audio, archive extraction and content services. No SDL, Qt or OpenGL backend is
added. This core uses Vulkan for frontend presentation, not hardware emulation.

The toolchain restricts header/library/package searches to the SDK. Function
probes link against the actual native stubs without a CRT and are never executed;
static-library probes falsely reported unavailable locale functions. The SDK
provides locale types/headers but lacks several locale runtime functions, so the
small `patches/mgba/native-locale-type.patch` uses a private formatting type for
upstream's string-locale fallback; `HAVE_XLOCALE` is removed from this target.
The patch is applied with zero fuzz to the fresh source. `HAVE_LOCALTIME_R` names
the frontend adapter, avoiding upstream's unimplemented fallback. `-z undefs`
permits that frontend-provided import; the generated binding table must still
resolve every core import when the title links.

`--build-id=sha1` keeps output repeatable. `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` prevents
upstream's version generator from discovering RetroArch's parent Git checkout;
the archive reports its own 0.11.0 version, with the exact source revision in
`build/cores/mgba/build.json`. That report also contains the SDK wrapper, source,
metadata and port-input hashes. No source checkout or environment is modified.

Outputs are `build/cores/stage/cores/mgba_libretro.so` and
`build/cores/stage/info/mgba_libretro.info`. The title build stages all shipped cores,
with metadata in both `info/` and `cores/` for existing saved configurations.
Changing the shipped core list requires rebuilding the frontend's native import
bindings. Console loading and manual gameplay remain separate target checks.


`MGBA_PS5` selects `/app0/config/mgba` for mGBA's optional standalone config
and disables `portable.ini` working-directory discovery. The zero-fuzz
`native-config-path.patch` avoids native `getcwd`/Unix home discovery; core
options continue to come from RetroArch's libretro environment.

## Large application allocations

`src/memory_ps5.cpp` maps allocations of at least 1 MiB with the native kernel
and keeps smaller requests on libc. The title linker wraps `malloc`, `calloc`,
`realloc` and `free` together, including the generated core binding references.
This flag is required because a 16 MiB 7z extraction allocation returned null
through the native libc import. The donor also uses mappings for large buffers;
this implementation tracks mappings in a mutex-protected list and never reads
headers before unknown pointers. Buffers allocated inside native libraries
remain libc-owned and are forwarded to native free/realloc. Resize of a mapped
buffer preserves its contents and leaves the old allocation intact on failure.
Resize of a libc-owned buffer remains a libc operation, including growth beyond
the threshold. Do not pass a mapped pointer to an API that privately frees or
reallocates it inside an unwrapped native library.

Patch 0076 reports 7z allocation/header/extraction failures without filenames
and checks allocation before copying extracted content. It logs errors only.


The mGBA libretro callback converts native XBGR to its declared XRGB8888 format
using `ps5-video.h` and a separate bounded video buffer. It leaves the renderer's
pixels intact for duplicate/cached frames. Upstream's 16-bit-only colour
correction/interframe-blending routines are not enabled by this 32-bit build.

Patch 0077 sets RGBA menu image decoding on every Vulkan context initialization
and requests RGBA textures for those decoded pixels. This is separate from core
XRGB frames. The Vulkan software-framebuffer callback returns false: callers
must retain their own original pixels, since exposing RGBA staging memory as
writable XRGB would let upload conversion mutate cached frames while paused.
FCEUmm uses its own buffer when that optional callback is unavailable.

On normal frontend return, `catchReturnFromMain` requests
`sceSystemServiceLoadExec("exit", nullptr)` and waits for asynchronous shell
termination on success. RetroArch has already cleaned up drivers and saved its
configuration. A failed request is logged and falls back to the existing CRT
termination path; it must not be described as a successful clean exit.

### Padded core presentation

Patch 0078 extends the existing 256-byte texture-row workaround to software
core presentation. The filter chain carries logical width separately from the
sampled image width and crops both triangle UVs to that initialized region.
Each pass owns one small vertex buffer per retired sync slot, so CPU updates do
not overwrite another in-flight frame. Swapchain reconstruction releases these
buffers. Hardware-provided images and intermediate pass outputs keep their own
extents; sampled format substitution is applied before computing padded width.
The host regression covers FCEUmm, the blank menu frame, GBA and GB widths across
repeated transitions. Console flicker acceptance is recorded in `evidence/mgba-native/`. This is
not validation of arbitrary Slang presets, history sampling or linear-filter
edge behaviour; those remain separate milestones.


## Snes9x core build and colour contract

`make snes9x` runs `tools/build-snes9x.sh` against pinned official libretro source
`fae2fea08f74180759ef540ee94259213f503480` (Snes9x 1.63). Its own libretro Makefile
selects the sources; CC/CXX/AR/LD are explicitly the project's SDK wrappers.
LTO remains off as upstream defaults, and upstream's no-strict-aliasing,
no-exceptions/no-RTTI flags remain. No alternate SDK, CRT, SDL or host library
is linked. The existing native linker script separates RX/R/RW pages. Native
imports and C++ SDK runtime references are bound by the frontend's explicit
union table; `-z undefs` permits these at core link, while the title link must
resolve every entry. Metadata uses the same official core-info revision as the
other cores; its upstream display_version says 1.61, while the core reports 1.63
plus its source revision. The metadata otherwise stays upstream unchanged.

The renderer retains RGB565 including its NTSC and hires paths. The callback
patch converts to a separate bounded XRGB8888 buffer, reports XRGB8888 at both
normal and subsystem load sites, and supplies the converted 32-bit pitch.
The existing frontend XRGB-to-RGBA conversion then feeds matching staging and
sampled textures. Cached native pixels remain unchanged. Tests cover every
RGB565 value end to end, non-tight pitch and 256/512/602/1024-pixel widths through
478 rows. These tests do not by themselves establish console acceptance of
NTSC filtering, HD Mode 7 or interlaced games.

Snes9x has C++ globals. `tooling/native/core_cxx_runtime.cpp` is linked locally
inside this core, hidden by upstream's version script. Its own __cxa_atexit list
runs in reverse registration order via a fini-array callback, so unloaded code
is never retained in the process-wide exit registry. The loader accepts bounded
DT_FINI_ARRAY/DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ, validates all targets before any initializer, and
runs finalizers in reverse array order on the last close before unmapping.
Reload gets a new registry; a rejected load executes no callbacks. This does not
add TLS, legacy init/fini functions or exception-unwind registration support.
As with initializers, lifecycle callbacks must not reenter this bounded loader.

## FBNeo native core contract

`make fbneo` uses pinned official libretro/FBNeo source
`6bb3167a044e19e7106a5110d5531aa9c6afa96f` and the project's native SDK wrappers.
The full upstream source selection remains, including ZIP/7z and CHD support;
no ROM, BIOS, samples or user-provided metadata is shipped. Official core-info
revision `5a74858ab2f7a50cebb5a6330895bc38899531c0` supplies the `.info` file.
Archive digests are verified before fresh extraction. The local make wrapper
removes obsolete GCC `-fforce-addr`, selects C++11 for SDK libc++, and disables
exceptions/RTTI because the native module loader has no unwind registration.
The shared core-local destructor registry handles C++ globals before unmapping.
Native imports are included in the title's explicit union table, so the core
and updated frontend must be deployed together.

Native 32-bit FBNeo output is already XRGB8888 (0x00RRGGBB). Drivers flagged
16-bit-only retain RGB565 internally; the video callback converts those frames
into a separate XRGB8888 buffer with a 32-bit pitch. Source pixels are never
mutated, and NULL duplicate-frame callbacks remain NULL. The existing frontend
converts XRGB into RGBA for the Vulkan texture upload. This is CPU emulation and
software rendering with Vulkan presentation, not Vulkan hardware emulation.

The MPEG layer 2/AMM decoder uses an exception solely to escape an exhausted
bit reader. The native patch substitutes an instance-local setjmp/longjmp
escape and the same false return. The traversed decoder frames have only
trivial local variables; no C++ destructor is bypassed. This is not general
exception support. Differential host tests compare the original and adapted
real decoder on complete and truncated synthetic layer 2 and AMM input. Core metadata
queries also use a bounded static version string, avoiding upstream's
unowned duplicate on each query.

At runtime FBNeo sets need_fullpath=true and block_extract=true: RetroArch
passes the whole archive to the core. Do not unpack arcade ZIP/7z collections
as single-content archives. BIOS lookup includes the frontend's system/fbneo/
and system/ directories and the content directory. User BIOS/ROM sets must
match the pinned core's requirements; a successful build is not a compatibility
claim for every supported board, disc format or subsystem.

FBNeo's writable driver catalogue uses two allocations: a bulk name store and
its pointer tables. Thousands of individual sub-1-MiB allocations otherwise
exhaust SceLibcInternal's small heap during BurnLibInit. The name store crosses
the frontend allocator's existing 1 MiB mapping threshold; that allocator and
all other cores stay unchanged. Catalogue construction validates lengths and
allocations before changing driver pointers, and exit restores the original
pointers before freeing storage. Repeated exit/reinitialization is safe.
Initialization failure is logged and causes regular/subsystem content loads to
return false. No partially initialized catalogue is used for game execution.

## Genesis Plus GX native core contract

`make genesis-plus-gx` uses official libretro/Genesis-Plus-GX source
`c2838c7dc4236fc2fe94e5dbd08b41486067918e` (archive SHA-256
`7ba2eab9d6dae71bb42e8208573300ad3475a4263e860178c4d19c36d85fc92b`).
Official core-info comes from `5a74858ab2f7a50cebb5a6330895bc38899531c0`,
SHA-256 `9793bff8d9e298a7ee0c94c0511dab242200ca60fbe87e3720eb9231a3e0166a`.
The supplied .info is reference material; only the hash-checked official file is
staged in info/ and cores/. The fresh source build uses this project's explicit
SDK compiler/archiver wrappers and native linker script/import union, without a
payload CRT. `HAVE_CDROM=0` disables Linux-host autodetection of physical CD-ROM
access, retaining CHD and disc-image codecs. `ZSTD_TRACE=0` disables optional weak
instrumentation hooks for which the title has no external provider. It does not
disable core/frontend error logging. Source, metadata, SDK wrapper and port-input
hashes are recorded in build/cores/genesis_plus_gx/build.json.

The software renderer, NTSC filters, cursors and Game Gear LCD persistence retain
upstream RGB565 storage. A separate bounded XRGB8888 callback buffer preserves the
cached source and the existing frontend's RGBA Vulkan upload contract. Conversion
uses the actual 720-pixel input stride and byte viewport offset; output is packed
at width*4 bytes per row. Rejected XRGB8888 negotiation rejects content through
upstream cleanup. Invalid views are logged and never read out of bounds. Skipped
frames still submit NULL. The patch normalizes libretro.c line endings only in
the disposable extraction and corrects the unused-return update_geometry helper
to void. Frontend video code and PS5_Vulkan require no change.

Upstream covers Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000 and Sega CD;
this is a software core using Vulkan presentation, not a Vulkan hardware renderer.
Its runtime uses need_fullpath=true and block_extract=false, allowing frontend
archive extraction. Place region-specific Sega CD BIOS files in the configured
system directory root, following the official .info names. No BIOS or ROM is
bundled. Console acceptance is limited to the systems and transitions actually
recorded in evidence; available build features do not establish full coverage.
