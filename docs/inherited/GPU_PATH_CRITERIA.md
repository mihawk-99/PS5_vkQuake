# The GPU path: acceptance criteria

Scoped before any code is written, because the previous path taught this project
what "done" has to mean before the work starts rather than after. Every criterion
names how it is verified, and the verification is a command or an artifact - not an
opinion.

## What this replaces, and what it must not break

The title renders today through `video_ps5` (`src/video_ps5.cpp` +
`src/display.cpp`): RGUI's 320x240 RGB565 framebuffer is converted and scaled on the
CPU, one pixel at a time, into a tiled 1920x1080 framebuffer in direct memory, and
handed to the display with `sceVideoOutSubmitFlip`. The menu is visible on the
console. **That path stays working throughout.** Every criterion below is additive:
if the GPU path is not yet better, `video_ps5` is still the driver that runs, and
the menu is still on screen.

## A - the 40 refusals, cleared

The linked libps5vk refuses this frontend's commands, and a refusal ends recording
with an error at `vkEndCommandBuffer`, so the command buffers never submit and the
screen stays black while every call returns success. The maintainer identified all
three sources and the frontend-side fix for each.

| # | Criterion | Where | How it is verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | No pipeline is created with `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_STRIP` | `vendor/retroarch/gfx/drivers/vulkan.c:2620`, `:2649`, `:2765` - the three sites that select a strip topology | `grep -c TRIANGLE_STRIP` over the configured `gfx/drivers/vulkan.c` is 0 in any `input_assembly.topology` assignment, and the trace has **zero** `only triangle lists without primitive restart` lines |
| A2 | The RGUI upload does not use a storage image | `vulkan_copy_staging_to_dynamic` chooses compute when `dynamic->format != staging->format` (`:1099-1104`); the compute path writes a `VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE` at binding 3 (`:1150-1156`) | the trace has **zero** `descriptor type 3 has no proven table entry` lines |
| A3 | Every sampler the frontend creates uses clamp-to-edge on all three axes | `vendor/retroarch/gfx/drivers_shader/shader_vulkan.cpp:2034-2036` (hardcoded REPEAT) and `:2087-2108` (preset-driven, mapping to repeat / mirrored-repeat / clamp-to-border / mirror-clamp) | the trace has **zero** `sampler address modes` lines |
| A4 | The refusal count is zero, not merely lower | all of the above | `grep -c '^vulkan: ' /app0/trace.txt` is **0** over a full run |

A2 is settled as the RGB8888 route. RGUI itself still produces packed RGBA4444
for the Vulkan driver; the port expands that data to full-range R,G,B,A bytes and
allocates both staging and dynamic textures as `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM`.
Matching formats select `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage`. The unused storage-image compute
upload shader is not compiled, since its descriptor is unsupported. This preserves
the agreed 32-bit texture route without claiming RGUI produces native 8-bit colour.

## B - the menu reaches the screen through the GPU

| # | Criterion | How it is verified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | The title runs on `video_vulkan`, not `video_ps5` | `/app0/trace.txt` shows RetroArch's Vulkan driver initialising, and `ps5_init entered` (this project's own driver) is **absent**, because only one video driver runs |
| B2 | The frame is presented through libps5vk's swapchain | `vkQueuePresentKHR` returns `VK_SUCCESS` and the driver's flip marker is reached; a presentation count appears in the trace |
| B3 | No command buffer ends in error | the trace carries no refusal line (A4) **and** no `vkEndCommandBuffer` failure is reported; this is the specific fault that produced a black screen with successful presents before |
| B4 | The console owner confirms RGUI is visible, rendered through the GPU | the owner's confirmation, which is the only witness for "on the screen" this project accepts |

## C - it is actually better, measured

The reason for doing this at all. A GPU path that renders the menu no faster than
the CPU path is not worth the swap, so it has to be shown to be faster.

| # | Criterion | How it is verified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | The per-frame CPU cost of presentation is gone | the per-pixel loop in `src/video_ps5.cpp`'s `ps5_frame` does not run under Vulkan; evidenced by the absence of the driver's frame marks and by the frontend's own frame timing |
| C2 | Frame rate at the menu is at least as good as the CPU path | measured frame count over a fixed `--watch` window, compared against the CPU path's number for the same window |
| C3 | A real core runs at its target rate | load a libretro core, run it for a fixed window, and record frames presented versus frames expected. This is the number the whole exercise is for |
| C4 | The result is reversible | `video_ps5` remains registered and selectable, so a regression in the GPU path can be undone by one line in `tools/apply-port-patches.py` |

C3 needs a core in the title folder. If no core is available when the rest is done,
C3 is recorded as **not measured** rather than inferred - the previous rounds
established what happens when an unverified assumption is treated as a result.

## D - the invariants hold

| # | Criterion |
| --- | --- |
| D1 | Driver changes require explicit user authorization and are documented and committed in `../PS5_Vulkan`. The user granted that authorization on 2026-09-19 for this rendering defect. |
| D2 | `tools/verify.sh` passes: format, unit, build, integration, evidence. |
| D3 | The port's changes to upstream remain named edits in `patches/series`, applied by `tools/apply-port-patches.py` to `build/ra-conf` only; `vendor/retroarch` is never edited. |
| D4 | Every step is verified by a command or an artifact, committed with its evidence, and written up in `docs/ACTIVE.md` and `docs/FINDINGS.md`. |

## Out of scope

- Audio. The frontend already reports `Failed to initialize audio driver. Will
  continue without audio.` and that is unchanged by this work.
- Shaders, filters, overlays and the XMB menu, beyond what comes free with the
  Vulkan driver. A1-A4 gate on the menus this project actually renders.
- Input. The pad driver already opens and delivers presses; nothing here changes it.
- Asking the maintainer for the `V0-sampler` or `V0-topology` probes. Every
  criterion above is reachable from this side. If A3 turns out to need repeat or
  mirrored-repeat sampling rather than clamp-to-edge, that is a scope change and
  comes back to the `docs/ACTIVE.md` open list rather than being assumed.

## Order of work

1. A1, A2, A3 as named patches, then one run. A4 is the gate: zero refusals.
2. Only then B - switch the compiled default to `vulkan`, one run, owner confirms.
3. Only then C - measure, because measuring before the path works measures nothing.

If A4 cannot be reached, the work stops there, the CPU path stays, and what was
learned is recorded. The menu on the screen is not put at risk for an optimisation.

## Current evidence

Current acceptance and artifacts live in `docs/ACTIVE.md`; dated runs are in
`docs/PHASE_LOG.md`. Successful Vulkan calls establish completion, while captured
pixels and the console owner's confirmation establish visible rendering.
