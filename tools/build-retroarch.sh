# are applied to that same copy - so vendor/retroarch is upstream exactly as it
# was fetched and build/ra-conf is upstream plus the named changes, compiled. A
# build that read the sources from vendor/ and the headers from build/ compiled
# RetroArch's untouched video_driver.c against the patched video_driver.h: it
# linked, it signed, and it started with video_drivers[] holding no ps5 entry at

    # the comment above rarch_main says what it does: without HAVE_MAIN, rarch_main
    # initialises and then runs the frontend's main loop; with it, rarch_main only
    # initialises and returns. The title built with it initialised every driver -
    # this project's video driver included, its display open at 1920x1080, per the
    # trace in the title folder - and then exited zero without drawing a frame.
    # The duplicate `main` symbol it was meant to avoid is removed by renaming
    # upstream's, in patches/series 0003.
    # This SDK's time.h only defines the POSIX clock ids when
    # __POSIX_VISIBLE >= 200112, which the -std=c11 the pipeline uses suppresses.
    # The ids are pre-defined here with the header's own values (CLOCK_REALTIME 0,
    # CLOCK_MONOTONIC 4), so this is the same declaration the header would have
    # made. Both are needed together: the header wraps the whole block in one
    # condition, so defining only the first hides the second.
    -DCLOCK_REALTIME=0 -DCLOCK_MONOTONIC=4
    # Assertions are compiled out. This SDK declares a standard BSD assert - it
    # expands to __assert(__func__, __FILE__, __LINE__, #e) - and __assert lives
    # only in libc.a, which this pipeline does not link: the title's C library is
    # runtime/libc.prx, loaded at run time, and the executable links the SDK's
    # weak stubs. An assert that fires would therefore be an undefined symbol at
    # link time rather than a message at run time. NDEBUG is what a release build
    # of RetroArch uses in any case, so nothing is lost that was meant to ship.

    # Screenshots, which is the only capture path this port has. RetroArch's own
    # `--max-frames=N --max-frames-ss --max-frames-ss-path=FILE` writes one at the end
    # of a fixed number of frames, and the goal this round is working toward asks for
    # frames *reaching the screen*: a picture read back from the frame the console was
    # handed is that evidence without a camera pointed at the display. The flag is off
    # in the configured tree (the whole block is `#ifdef HAVE_SCREENSHOTS`), so the
    # options do not exist and the run exits with nothing to read. Nothing else in the
    # build changes: the readback is the Vulkan driver's own path.

    # goes through tools/build.sh, which builds a stub table from the symbols the
    # executable imports and refuses to write one for a symbol no public SDK stub
    # exports - so a hook nobody calls still stops the build, with
    # ZSTD_trace_decompress_end as the message. A stronger check than the linker's
    # weak-symbol rule, and the right answer is to not emit the hook: ZSTD_TRACE=0
