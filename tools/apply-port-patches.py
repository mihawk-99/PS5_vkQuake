"""Apply this port's changes to RetroArch's sources.

    python3 tools/apply-port-patches.py <configured-tree>

Why a script and not `patch`. A unified diff carries line numbers and context
taken from one revision, so it either fails outright or applies in the wrong
place when upstream moves by a few lines. This port's changes to RetroArch are
small insertions at known anchors, and each anchor is a line upstream has no
reason to change, so the changes are matched on their anchors and are safe to
re-run:

    gfx/video_driver.h   declare the driver beside video_null's declaration
    gfx/video_driver.c   list the driver in video_drivers[] beside &video_null
    qb/config.params.sh  give HAVE_XKBCOMMON the same `auto` default that every
                         other optional library already declares, so that
                         --disable-xkbcommon is an option configure accepts

Every edit prints `applied` or `present`, so the script reports what it did rather
than leaving the tree in an unknown state. Nothing is ever written to
vendor/retroarch: the tree passed in is the configured copy under build/.

Exit status is 0 when every edit is present at the end, 1 otherwise.

        # the upload shader below. So the refusal fires once per
        # vulkan_init_pipelines call, which is once at init and once per swapchain
        # recreation - three times in the recorded run, all three the same line.
        #

        # (R8G8B8A8), so the formats cannot differ and
        # vulkan_copy_staging_to_dynamic never takes its compute branch: the branch
