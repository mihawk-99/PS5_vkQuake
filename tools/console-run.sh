# PS5 RetroArch - run one title on the console and capture the console's own log.
#
#   tools/console-run.sh PPSA99169            listen, launch, capture, judge
#   tools/console-run.sh PPSA99169 --dry-run  report what would happen
#
# Why this exists. Two things learned the hard way on this console:
#
#   1. It runs ONE title at a time. Launching while another is running is refused
#      with 0x80940010 and nothing starts, so a "crash" read from a stale log is
#      really a refusal. This script checks what is running first and refuses to
#      launch into a busy console unless --force is given.
#   2. Every title's process is named `eboot.bin`, so a capture is only
#      attributable if it is delimited. The listener is started first, its
#      position in the stream is recorded, and every judgement below is made from
#      the lines after that mark.
#
# The console's log is the only witness this project trusts: FTP reads on this
# console have been measured returning another title's bytes for a path created
# moments earlier (docs/FINDINGS.md).

error: $busy is running, and this console runs one title at a time.
       Launching $title now would be refused with 0x80940010 and nothing would
       start. Close $busy on the console, then run this again.
       Use --force to launch anyway (it will be refused, which is occasionally
       what you want to demonstrate).
