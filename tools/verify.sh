# Each gate is a precondition plus the command docs/inherited/TESTING.md documents. Until
# a gate's script exists the gate reports the file it is waiting for and fails,
# which is how a project that has not built anything yet stays honest about it.
# Adding a check means adding it to the script a gate already calls, so this
# file changes only when the set of gates changes.
#
# Details of what each gate means and how to add to it: docs/inherited/TESTING.md.
