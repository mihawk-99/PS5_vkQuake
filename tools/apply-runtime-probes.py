#
# Why this exists. Every probe in this project is written into the configured copy
# of RetroArch, and `tools/retroarch-sources.sh` rebuilds that copy from upstream -
# so a probe vanishes the moment anyone reconfigures, which is exactly what
# happened to the set that finally found the input fault. These are kept here
# instead: version-controlled, re-appliable in one command, and never part of the
# shipping build, because `tools/build-title.sh` does not call this script.
#
# Why probes in the frontend at all. The kernel log cannot see inside the
# frontend, and RetroArch's own file logger is initialised *after* it parses its
# config - so anything that goes wrong during startup is invisible to both. A line
# written to /app0/trace.txt from inside the failing function is the only
# instrument that works there, and it is what turned three "somewhere in init"
# theories into named statements.
#
# The probes are plain fprintf calls appended to the title's trace file. They are
# deliberately not routed through src/trace.cpp: the configured tree is C, and a
# raw stdio call is one line that cannot itself be the reason a build fails.
#
# What each one is for is in the note beside it - these are the landmarks that
# were hard to find the first time.
