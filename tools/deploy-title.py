# Modelled on ../PS5_Vulkan/tools/deploy.sh, which is the deployment path that
# works against this console; tools/ps5_ftp.py carries the three server quirks
# that made a from-scratch implementation fail silently.
#
# The verification is size-based rather than a full read-back on purpose. A
# read-back is the stronger check, but it doubles every transfer, and the
# failure this guards against - the console keeping the previous bytes while
# reporting success - shows up as a size that does not match. `--check` reads
# the digests properly when that matters.
#
# Configuration comes from the ignored .env; the console address is never
# committed.
