# PS5 RetroArch - the frontend's own structure, checked where a console is not
# needed.
#
#   python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
#
# Three things are checked here, and each is a way this project has already been
# wrong once:
#
#   1. the driver table. The port registers video_ps5 in RetroArch's
#      video_drivers[] through patches/. A build once linked and signed with the
#      patched header and the unpatched table, so the frontend compiled, started,
#      and had no ps5 entry at all. The check is a relocation in the object file,
#      which is a fact about what was built rather than about what was written.
#
#   2. the frame layout. src/display.cpp writes the console's frame through a
#      tiled addressing function, and a wrong one produces a scrambled picture
#      rather than a crash - a failure that a console run reports as "the screen
#      looks wrong", which is expensive to debug. The formula is compiled here,
#      from the source, and checked for the property that matters: it is a
#      one-to-one map onto the frame's own offsets. It is also pinned against a
#      table of values, so a change to the arithmetic cannot be silent.
#
#   3. the artifact. eboot.bin is a fake self and names the title its folder is
#      named after; both are what the console's loader reads.

        eboot.bin is not an ELF, so its first bytes are not an ELF header: it is a
        fake self, a small header followed by a table of segments, and the ELF
        program image is written into the first segment. Reading the file as an
        ELF - which an earlier version of this test did - fails on the container's
        second byte and proves nothing about the program inside it.

        What the container's own fields mean is deliberately not decoded here.
        Their layout belongs to the pipeline's self writer
        (tooling/native/self_container.cpp), and a test that restates it would be
        a second, drifting copy - as the two attempts before this one were. What
        is checked instead is what a wrong build would break: a real ELF image is
        inside the file, it is 64-bit x86-64, and it declares an entry point.
