# Cross-compile PPSSPP with this repository's SDK; never search host headers/libraries.
#
# The pinned tree is configured directly (not through add_subdirectory): upstream
# resolves module paths and source lists through ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}, so it has to be
# the top-level project. Everything this port adds to the build lives in this file
# and in patches/ppsspp/.
#
# The compiler is the payload SDK's own wrapper rather than tooling/prospero-clang18:
# it is the one that knows where the SDK's linker script (prx.script) lives, and it
# is what every other core build in this repository uses.
