/*
 * PS5 RetroArch - the title's entry point.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Mihawk

 *
 * RetroArch's own `main` is one line: `return rarch_main(argc, argv, NULL)`. So
 * the entry point is not reconciled with RetroArch's, it simply calls the same
 * function with the arguments this title wants, and the pipeline's `_start` stays
 * the process entry. That is the whole of the "entry point" problem the plan
 * listed.
 *
 * The display is opened by the video driver, not here: `video_ps5` owns it, and
 * this file's job is to hand RetroArch its arguments and let its runloop drive.
 *
 * Arguments, and why each is here:
 *   -f              fullscreen, which on a console is the only mode
 *   -c <path>       the config to read and write, inside the title's own folder
 *   --verbose       so the run is readable in the console's log
 *   --menu          start with the menu up rather than waiting for content: this
 *                   title has no content, and the menu is what is being proven
 *
 * Why this file writes a trace. The first run of this title on the console ended
 * with the kernel reporting `eboot.bin calls exit() exit_value=0` and nothing
 * else: no output, no crash, no message. A program that exits zero and says
 * nothing is indistinguishable from one that never reached `main`, and the
 * console's log cannot be asked which it was. So the entry point and the video
 * driver append a line per step to /app0/trace.txt, and after a run that file
 * says how far it got. See src/trace.hpp.

 * and for a bad array length (`call __throw_length_error` followed by `ud2`), so
 * something threw and the exception never came back as an error.
 *
 * An abort is also the one failure with no message anywhere: the title's trace
 * says how far it got, and the frontend's log is a buffer that dies with the
 * process. libc++abi still knows the exception while terminate runs, so the type
